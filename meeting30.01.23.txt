Meeting:

- Researched Automatic program repair.
- Went indepth in AST(abstract syntax trees)
- Confirmed that solhint uses ANTLR for Solidity to parse contracts into an ASTs and uses rules created to find linting and security issues.

- Modelling how the detection for different vulnerabilities can look like or how to improve them. Propose and implement strategy rules to perform APR(automatic program repair.
- Refactor the code I used to categorize identified contracts into exploitable and unexploitable, downloading all contracts in a category, and running all contracts from a program.

Language syntax, ML
